# How To Contribute

Contributions are more than welcome! The more people who contribute to the project the better Empire will be for everyone. Below are a few guidelines for submitting contributions.

## Creating Github Issues

Please first review the existing Empire issues to see if the error was resolved with a fix in the development branch or if we chose not to fix the error for some reason.

The more information you provide in a Github issue the easier it will be for us to track down and fix the problem:

- Please provide the version of Empire you are using.
- Please provide the OS and Python versions that you are using.
- Please describe the expected behavior and the encountered error.
  - The more detail the better!
  - Include any actions taken just prior to the error.
  - Please post a screenshot of the error, a link to a Pastebin dump of the error, or embedded text of the error.
- Any additional information.
